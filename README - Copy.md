# Autismo_Seals_Unit_Mod
 Github repository for the Autismo Seals Custom Addon

NOTE: Files contained in MAIN may contain bugs or WIP features. MAIN also contains various non-release PBOs. Never clone MAIN except for dev purposes, always take an archived release for use if you don't want to use Steam Workshop.

While the developers have avoided using copyrighted assets, either as placeholders or as release assets, we acknowledge that some of our 3rd-party-provided assets may be copyrighted without our knowledge. If you are the owner of copyrighted assets contained in this repository/addon, contact us for a swift removal.

This mod contains PBOs from other mods. These are always authorized repacks, and no edits to them have been made unless otherwise specified. For our original PBOs, we may occasionally look at other scripts/mods for learning how to do things so some code may be similar, but we take pride in figuring out how to make things ourselves.
